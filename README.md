#Safiri
Server- Express clone
This is safiri a simplified version of Express. Just playing around on building servers to understand what express does 

I implemented the following parts

Part 1: app.listen(port) and app.get(url, callback)
      Also support req and res inside route callback with
      req.query
      res.send()
      res.json
Part 2: app.post(url, callback)

Part 3: app.use(routePrefix, callback)

Part 4: res.render(name, options)

Part 5: req.params

 Part 6: next() inside route
